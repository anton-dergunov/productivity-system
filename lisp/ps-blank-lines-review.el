;;; ps-blank-lines-review.el --- Review and apply blank-line proposals -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; The writing half of blank-line recovery.  `ps-blank-lines.el' finds what
;; could be restored; this walks the proposals one file at a time through
;; Ediff, and saves a file only when the review actually changed it.
;;
;; Buffer A is your file as it stands, buffer B the same file with its blank
;; lines back — left is what you have, right is what you would end up with, the
;; diff-review convention.  Both are editable, so both of Ediff's own copy keys
;; do something real: `b' applies a change into the file, `a' drops one from
;; the proposal.  The review therefore starts from *everything accepted*, which
;; is the right default for blank lines the user once typed and a phone
;; deleted, while still allowing the change-at-a-time reading.
;;
;; What gets written is settled by `ps/blank-lines-review--outcome': a file the
;; user edited by hand wins, otherwise the proposal.  `+' (accept everything)
;; and `x' (drop everything) reset *both* sides, precisely so that the question
;; cannot arise after them.  Both keys come from what stock Ediff leaves free —
;; `!' is not free, it is `ediff-update-diffs' — and `ediff-mode-map' is
;; `ediff-defvar-local', so neither leaks into an unrelated Ediff.
;;
;; Three guards stand between a review and the disk, in the order they fire:
;;
;;   - A file whose buffer is modified, or whose text no longer matches what
;;     the scan read, is skipped rather than reviewed.  The proposal was
;;     computed against a specific version, and applying it to a newer one
;;     would revert whatever came in between.
;;   - Nothing is written when the outcome is identical to the file, so
;;     dropping everything is a no-op rather than a rewrite.
;;   - Before saving, the outcome is checked against the scanned text with
;;     blank lines removed.  Equal means only blank lines changed, which is the
;;     whole promise of the feature; unequal means the review edited content,
;;     and that is never saved silently.
;;
;; The review takes over the content area of the current frame rather than
;; opening frames of its own — see the Layout section for why that needs global
;; variables held for the length of the session.
;;
;; The Ediff exit path is load-bearing and was verified rather than assumed.
;; `ediff-really-quit' runs `ediff-cleanup-hook', then `ediff-janitor', then
;; `ediff-quit-hook' (whose global value is `ediff-cleanup-mess'), and finally
;; the *buffer-local* part of `ediff-after-quit-hook-internal'.  A hook added
;; with `add-hook ... nil t' lands in the local value ahead of the `t' that
;; stands for the global one, so the save below runs while buffers A and B and
;; the control buffer are all still alive.  Advancing to the next file has to
;; wait for `ediff-after-quit-hook-internal', by which point the session is
;; fully torn down and a new one can start.  `ediff-keep-variants' is set
;; buffer-locally in the control buffer because `ediff-janitor' reads it there,
;; and without it a user who has customized it away from t gets a prompt about
;; killing their own file buffer between those two hooks.

;;; Layout

;; Ediff defaults to a control panel in its own frame on a graphical display,
;; and to stacking A above B.  A review wants neither: it should take over the
;; content area of the frame the user is already in, with the two versions side
;; by side.  Both variables have to be set *globally* for the duration —
;; `ediff-setup-windows' reads the setup function out of the control buffer,
;; but the first layout runs inside `ediff-buffers', before that buffer is ours
;; to configure.  They are restored when the queue drains.
;;
;; The file tree is hidden first because `ediff-setup-windows-plain-compare'
;; calls `delete-other-windows': hiding it gives Ediff the whole content area.
;;
;; The report stays put in a *side* window — the one kind
;; `delete-other-windows' leaves alone, so it survives every session in the
;; queue without a custom window-setup function.  Two window parameters carry
;; that: `no-delete-other-windows', and `no-other-window' so Ediff's
;; `(other-window 1)' cannot land buffer A in the report.  A main window has to
;; be selected before Ediff runs, because `delete-other-windows' signals an
;; error when the selected window is a side window.
;;
;; It goes on the *right*, where the report already was: the file tree owns the
;; left, so the diff opening on the left is the diff taking the tree's place
;; rather than the report's.
