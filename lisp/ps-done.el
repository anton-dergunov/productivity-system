;;; ps-done.el --- Visual fading and folding of DONE org tasks -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Finished work recedes: every DONE subtree is covered by a fade overlay in
;; `ps/done-fade-color' (`auto' derives it from the theme's `shadow' face), and
;; `ps/done-collapse' / `ps/done-expand' fold and unfold those subtrees.  The
;; overlays are rebuilt after a state change, after a revert, and on a debounced
;; idle timer after edits -- never on every keystroke.
;;
;; Two traps, both hit in practice:
;;
;; - The fade scan walks `org-outline-regexp-bol', never `org-heading-regexp'.
;;   The latter makes the title optional, so a line holding a lone "*" -- what a
;;   half-typed heading looks like -- matches it though Org does not consider it
;;   a headline, and `org-get-todo-state' then signals "Before first headline"
;;   in a file with no headline yet.
;; - The idle rebuild (`ps/done--refade-now') demotes errors to a message.  It
;;   fires while the user is typing, in whatever half-finished state the buffer
;;   is in, and a cosmetic rebuild must never interrupt editing.
;;
;; Design: design/editing/org-display-fixes.md.
