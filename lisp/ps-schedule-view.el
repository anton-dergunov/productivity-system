;;; ps-schedule-view.el --- Timeline and Events views for the Schedule section -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Renders the org-agenda Schedule (time-grid) section in two styles:
;;
;;   Timeline — time axis with a tick at each grid interval:
;;     08:00-08:15 ┆ [cat] [STATE] [PRI] [emoji]  Title…
;;     08:00       ┆
;;     10:00-14:00 ┆ [cat] [STATE] [PRI] [emoji]  Title…
;;     ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┆┄┄┄┄┄┄  now · 13:47  ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄
;;     15:00       ┆ [cat] [STATE] [PRI] [emoji]  Title…   ⚠ overlap
;;
;;   Events — same but grid ticks hidden; only timed events shown.
;;
;; The ┆ bar is fixed at column 12 (0-indexed).  Task body uses the same
;; column geometry as ps-agenda-layout, shifted right by 14 columns.
;;
;; Requires ps-agenda-layout to be loaded first.  Sets
;; `ps/schedule-view-override' (declared in ps-agenda-layout) so the layout
;; pass leaves the Schedule section untouched.
;;
;; Auto-refresh: a timer fires at the start of each calendar minute so the
;; now-line and DONE-task visibility stay current.  Cursor and scroll are
;; preserved across refreshes.
