;;; ps-file-tree.el --- File tree sidebar (treemacs) helpers -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; The vault's folders and files in a treemacs side window, bent from a view of
;; code projects into a navigator for notes: one project for the whole vault
;; with its root line hidden, top-level folders as section headers, names shown
;; without ".org" and with "_" as a space, file sets, an explicit order, and a
;; highlight that follows the current file without ever expanding anything.
;; Design and rationale: design/files-and-windows/file-tree.md.
;;
;; The width is pinned with `window-preserve-size', never `window-size-fixed': a
;; preserved size holds through frame resizes, while a divider drag retries
;; ignoring preserved sizes and so still works.  `window-size-fixed' (what
;; treemacs's own width lock uses) blocks the drag outright.
;;
;; Four workarounds for treemacs, all load-bearing:
;;
;; 1. `ps/file-tree--decorate' re-applies the hidden root, the section gaps and
;;    the bold headers after every render.  treemacs has no hide-root option and
;;    reports expand/collapse through no hook, so the pass runs from several
;;    hooks, a buffer-local `post-command-hook' and our own commands.  It
;;    changes no characters, so it cannot trigger itself.
;; 2. `ps/file-tree--follow' finds the current file with the *pure* lookup
;;    `ps/file-tree--visible-node-position', never `treemacs-find-visible-node',
;;    which falls back to expanding ancestors when a node's position is not
;;    cached -- the usual case for a file.
;; 3. `ps/file-tree-node-lookup-setup' advises `treemacs-find-file-node' to
;;    match by `:path'.  The name transformer means a file's line no longer
;;    spells its file name, so treemacs's text-search fallback fails and returns
;;    nil, which its callers do not check: a shown file deleted from outside
;;    Emacs killed the file-watch timer.  Keep the advice narrow -- it answers
;;    only for nodes that are drawn, and leaves the rest (expanding to reveal)
;;    to treemacs.
;; 4. `ps/file-tree-annotations-setup' guards
;;    `treemacs--apply-annotations-deferred', whose half-second timer holds a
;;    buffer position that any re-render invalidates (a vault switch re-renders
;;    several times), signalling (wrong-type-argument number-or-marker-p nil)
;;    once per expanded node.
;;
;; Inside `window-size-change-functions', find the tree per frame
;; (`ps/file-tree--frame-window'): `treemacs-get-local-window' consults the
;; selected frame, and the hook can report another one.

`org-agenda-files' via `ps/agenda-files-refresh' when that is bound, since a
full rescan is the same work a file-set switch or an external change (a file
appearing on disk) may need reflected there too.

Heavier than treemacs's own incremental refresh -- appropriate for an
explicit user action (the header-line button, the menu item, or a file-set
switch), not for every automatic file-watch event.

Collapses via `treemacs-collapse-all-projects' rather than
`ps/file-tree-collapse-all': the latter deliberately leaves a hidden root
expanded, and a root that never closes is a root whose children are never
re-read -- which would leave the top-level entries frozen as the set changes.

  "Return non-nil when BTN is still worth applying deferred annotations to.
Installed as `:before-while' advice on `treemacs--apply-annotations-deferred'.

Expanding a directory arms a 0.5 second timer holding the *buffer position*
of the node expanded.  Nothing re-checks that the node survived, so any
re-render inside that window leaves the timer pointing at a line that is no
longer a node: `:depth' reads back nil and treemacs's own
`(1+ (treemacs-button-get btn :depth))' signals

    (wrong-type-argument number-or-marker-p nil)

once per node that had been expanded.  A vault switch provokes this every
time -- it collapses and re-expands the tree and then re-roots it several
times over three seconds -- but so does any refresh landing within half a
second of an expand.

Skipping costs nothing here: the annotations are the git-status decorations,
and `treemacs-git-mode' is off in this configuration, so the pass applies an
empty table to nodes that have since been redrawn anyway.  The guard stays
correct if treemacs starts checking the node itself, so it is safe to leave
in place."
