;;; ps-blank-lines-engine.el --- Transfer blank lines from an ancestor version -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Given the working-tree version of an Org file and a healthy ancestor version
;; of the same file, produce a proposal that carries the ancestor's blank lines
;; onto the working tree's content.  Pure: text in, text out, no I/O.
;;
;; Content always comes from the working tree — mobile is the source of truth
;; for what the user wrote.  Only `lead', `sep', `bof' and `eof' come from the
;; ancestor.  Node bodies, heading lines and child order are copied untouched,
;; so a proposal cannot change content; `ps/blank-lines-propose' re-checks that
;; with `ps/blank-lines-strip-equal-p' before returning, and refuses on failure.
;;
;; Resolution, in order:
;;
;;   lead — copy verbatim from the matched ancestor node.  Never rule-driven:
;;          it is unambiguously a property of the node and travels with it.
;;   sep  — a boundary gap, so it is keyed on the ordered *pair* of adjacent
;;          nodes even though it is stored on the follower.  Ladder:
;;            1. exact edge      the same two nodes were adjacent in the ancestor
;;            2. half-edge       the same predecessor, same follower level
;;            3. fitted rule     see `ps/blank-lines-rule-cell'
;;            4. keep            no evidence, so leave the gap alone
;;          Rungs 3 and 4 fire only at seams created by a move, an insertion or
;;          a deletion — a handful of gaps per file, often none.
;;   body — the working tree's, except for the whole-body swap below.
;;
;; A node whose `sep' is nil is the first content inside its parent; that gap
;; is the parent's `lead' and is resolved there.  Nil `sep' is structural, so
;; it is read off the working tree and never resolved.
;;
;; Bodies are opaque, so blank lines lost *inside* one cannot be repaired
;; line-by-line — that would mean aligning prose.  One safe case covers it: if
;; the ancestor body and the working-tree body have identical non-blank lines
;; and differ only in blanks, the ancestor's body is adopted wholesale.  The
;; precondition is itself the proof that content does not change.
