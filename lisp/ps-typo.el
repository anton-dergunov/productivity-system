;;; ps-typo.el --- High-precision, multilingual typo checking for Org -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A quiet, multilingual word-level typo checker for Org buffers, built on top
;; of Jinx (https://github.com/minad/jinx, an `enchant'-backed spell checker).
;;
;; Design goals (see docs/typo-checker.md for the full rationale):
;;
;; * High precision, low recall.  A flagged word should almost always be a real
;;   typo.  Recall is intentionally sacrificed.
;;
;; * Multilingual by union.  Every configured language is loaded at once and a
;;   word is flagged only when *no* language recognises it.  So "calor" (valid
;;   Spanish) and Cyrillic words are never flagged inside English prose.  This
;;   is the highest-precision rule available and needs no language detection.
;;
;; * Skips code and markup.  Org src/example blocks, =verbatim=, ~code~, links,
;;   file paths and "code-like" tokens (camelCase, snake_case, URLs, @handles,
;;   versions) are never checked, using Jinx's face/regexp exclusion driven by
;;   Org's own fontification.
;;
;; * Cheap.  Jinx checks only the visible window on an idle timer; no LLM.
;;
;; This module is the thin, testable glue around Jinx: the regexp exclusion set,
;; the optional near-miss precision gate, and the optional correction-suggestion
;; ordering by detected language.  Dictionary lookup, suggestions and rendering
;; stay inside Jinx.  Nothing here requires Jinx to be installed at *load* time;
;; the engine is only touched from `ps/typo-setup' onwards, so the pure helpers
;; remain unit-testable with a bare `emacs -Q'.

(require 'subr-x)

;; Jinx / guess-language are optional at load time; declare to quiet the byte
;; compiler.  They are soft-required from `ps/typo-setup'.
