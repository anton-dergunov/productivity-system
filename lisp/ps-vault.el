;;; ps-vault.el --- Vault registry, per-vault state and scaffolding -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; A *vault* is one Org folder: the directory `my-org-base-directory' points at.
;; Everything the system shows -- agenda, file tree, journal, situations -- comes
;; from exactly one vault at a time.  This module owns the list of known vaults,
;; the per-vault machine state, and the scaffolding for a brand new one.  The
;; orchestration of an actual switch lives in `ps-vault-switch'.
;;
;; It is deliberately dependency-free (cl-lib/seq/subr-x only), because
;; `config.org' requires it at the very top of Bootstrap -- before packages are
;; initialised and before the other modules are on `load-path'.  That is also
;; what keeps it testable under `emacs -Q --batch'.
;;
;; Two files hold state, and both are read as *data* with `read', never `load'ed:
;;
;;   <user-emacs-directory>/vaults.eld   the registry -- known vaults + current
;;   <vault>/.ps/state.el                per-vault machine state
;;
;; `load'ing a machine-written file would make it arbitrary eval; parsing a plist
;; can only ever produce data.  Both parsers are total: a truncated or garbage
;; file costs the settings it held, never a working Emacs.  Both preserve keys
;; they do not recognise, so an older Emacs does not eat a newer one's settings.
;;
;; The vault/system settings boundary this module draws:
;;
;;   system      config.org's `* Settings' -- fonts, theme, layout: how things look
;;   vault       <vault>/workspace.org -- icons, file sets, situations: hand-authored
;;   vault       <vault>/.ps/state.el -- what the UI toggles, machine-written
;;
;; `ps/vault-scoped-variables' names the globals a switch must *reset*, not merely
;; re-set.  This matters because `workspace.org' loading is additive and partial:
;; `ps/material-icons-add' merges rather than replaces, and the plain `setq's only
;; take effect if the incoming vault happens to set the same variable.  Without a
;; reset, vault A's categories and situations leak into vault B.  The defaults are
;; *captured* at load time (`ps/vault-capture-defaults', called from config.org
;; immediately before the first `ps/load-workspace-config') rather than restated
;; here, so they cannot drift from `* Settings'.
