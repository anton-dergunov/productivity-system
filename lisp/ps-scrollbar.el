;;; ps-scrollbar.el --- Auto-hiding scroll-position indicator -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; A minimal, auto-hiding scroll-position indicator: a small coloured "pill" at
;; the right edge of a window that appears while you scroll and fades when idle.
;; It is not draggable (macOS would not let this borderless child frame stay
;; put under a drag, see below) -- instead, click anywhere in the track to
;; jump there, or scroll with the wheel/trackpad/keyboard (smooth via
;; ultra-scroll).  The native scroll bar is disabled in config.org because the
;; macOS NS toolkit ignores its face (it can't be themed or auto-hidden).
;;
;; The pill is a tiny child frame whose background colour is the thumb, sized to
;; the thumb and positioned at its location.  A few hard-won notes about the
;; macOS NS build (especially behind a scaled / mirrored virtual display, e.g.
;; BetterDisplay):
;; - The thumb is a solid-coloured frame, not an image: a narrow rectangle drawn
;;   inside an SVG collapses to ~1px on a scaled display, while frame sizes
;;   render correctly.
;; - A child frame composites on a mirrored display (a top-level frame would,
;;   but it carries an unremovable window shadow); however it is invisible if
;;   its content is painted before it is shown, so we show first, then redisplay.
;; - Our own `window-size-change-functions' handler must ignore the size changes
;;   we make, or it destroys the pill mid-render.
;; - The pill width scales with the actual fringe width (a fixed pixel count is
;;   too thin on a HiDPI screen).
;; - macOS lets the user move/resize this borderless window and no frame
;;   parameter prevents it; an accidental nudge is snapped back from the timer.

Emacs run a redisplay, which on the NS build enters a nested AppKit event

origin.  WR/BR/BT are the window's (basic and body) right/bottom edges and
PL/PT the parent frame's native origin, all in absolute screen pixels; IT/IB
are the window's inside (text-area) top/bottom, already frame-relative.
MR is the right display margin in pixels (nil or 0 when there is none).

The track is anchored to the window's *right edge* and is only as wide as
the chrome that is not margin: a display margin belongs to the text column,
not to the track.  Emacs excludes margins from the window body, so the naive
width `WR - BR' silently swallows them -- and once a centred reading column
is in play (see `lisp/ps-prose-width.el', which sets margins of tens of
columns) that turned the pill into a huge block floating well left of the
window edge, since its width scales with the track and it is centred inside
it.  Subtracting MR and measuring back from WR fixes both at once.

Measuring from WR rather than skipping MR forward from BR also keeps this
correct whichever side of the margin the fringe is drawn on: Emacs puts the
fringe between margin and text by default, while `visual-fill-column' (which
is what creates margins here) passes OUTSIDE-MARGINS to `set-window-fringes'
and so keeps the fringe flush with the window edge.  Only the latter leaves
the track over real fringe pixels -- which is also what keeps a bare-track
click arriving as `right-fringe' (see `ps/scrollbar-mode-map') -- but the
pill is a child frame painted on top, so it lands at the edge either way.

With MR of 0 this is exactly the original geometry: LEFT comes back to BR."
