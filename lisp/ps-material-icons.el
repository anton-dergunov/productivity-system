;;; ps-material-icons.el --- Render Material Symbols glyphs as icons -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Renders Google's Material Symbols font glyphs as Emacs images, without any
;; per-icon SVG files.  A glyph is drawn into an in-memory SVG `<text>' element
;; (mirroring the attributes the old icon SVGs used) and turned into an image via
;; `create-image', so it goes through the same pipeline — and gets the same
;; sizing/alignment — as a normal image icon.
;;
;; Icons are named by their Material Symbols name (e.g. "edit_square" or
;; "Edit Square"); names are resolved to codepoints from the official
;; `*.codepoints' list shipped alongside this file.  Three declarative maps
;; drive the agenda and file-tree icons:
;;   `ps/material-icons-category-map'        — <Category>.org basename -> icon
;;   `ps/material-icons-folder-map'          — folder name -> its own icon
;;   `ps/material-icons-folder-contents-map' — folder name -> icon for its files
;;
;; The colour is a face rather than a fixed value, so icons follow the theme.
;; An image cannot be recoloured by a face after the fact -- the fill is baked
;; into the SVG -- so the face is read each time an icon is drawn, and
;; `ps/material-icons-color-changed-p' tells a theme-change hook when the
;; already-built icons need drawing again.
