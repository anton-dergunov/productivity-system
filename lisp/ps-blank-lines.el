;;; ps-blank-lines.el --- Recover blank lines lost to mobile Org editors -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Org files edited in Beorg or Orgzly come back with their blank lines gone:
;; both apps parse a heading into (heading line, content string) and trim that
;; string's leading and trailing whitespace on write.  Across the strip commits
;; in the author's history that cost 111 blank lines between a heading and its
;; first body line, and 104 between a body line and the next heading.
;;
;; Those blank lines are deliberate and not describable by a rule, so they are
;; recovered from the version of the file that still has them — git already
;; holds it, because the periodic sync commits whatever Dropbox delivers.
;;
;; This module is the driver: it scans the Org directory, picks each file's
;; healthiest ancestor (`ps-blank-lines-git.el'), fits the rule over the
;; healthiest known version of every file, proposes per file
;; (`ps-blank-lines-engine.el'), and reports.  The model lives in
;; `ps-blank-lines-tree.el'.
;;
;; The scan itself writes nothing — it is also the detector, and the only one
;; that catches Beorg, whose own reinsertion leaves level-1 conformance looking
;; perfect while body and level-2 gaps are gone.  Files are written only
;; through `ps-blank-lines-review.el', one Ediff session at a time, and only
;; for what the user accepts there.
;;
;; See `design/editing/blank-line-recovery.md'.
