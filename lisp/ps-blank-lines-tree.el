;;; ps-blank-lines-tree.el --- Org file as a tree of nodes with explicit gaps -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; The representation underneath blank-line recovery (see
;; `design/editing/blank-line-recovery.md').  An Org file parses into a
;; *tree of nodes*, never into a flat line sequence with a parallel gap
;; vector.  Two reasons, both load-bearing:
;;
;; 1. A node's body is atomic.  Reordering headings changes only their order,
;;    but reordering lines inside prose destroys its meaning — so a body is
;;    carried verbatim and is never split for alignment, never reordered.  A
;;    happy consequence: a blank line inside a `#+begin_src' block lives inside
;;    a body and is simply unreachable, where a flat model would classify it as
;;    a boundary gap and could delete it.
;;
;; 2. Gap ownership turns on the *level relationship* between adjacent nodes,
;;    which a flat model does not have.  The blank after `* A' belongs to A even
;;    when A has no body and the next line is its first child's heading — so
;;    reordering A's children keeps the blank welded to A.
;;
;; Exactly two gap slots per node, plus two for the file:
;;
;;   lead — blanks immediately AFTER this node's heading line, whatever follows
;;          (its own body, or its first child's heading).
;;   sep  — blanks immediately BEFORE this node's heading line.  nil when the
;;          node is the first content inside its parent, because that gap is
;;          then the parent's `lead'.  So `sep' and `lead' never name the same
;;          blank run.
;;   bof  — blanks before the first content line (the root's `lead').
;;   eof  — trailing blanks.
;;
;; Between them these account for every blank line in a file exactly once, so
;; `ps/blank-lines-render' is total and `render ∘ parse' is the identity.
;;
;; `sep' is *stored* on the node that follows the gap because that is the slot a
;; blank run before a heading lives in.  It is *resolved* on the ordered pair of
;; adjacent nodes — storing it here does not make it a property of the node.
;;
;; Two deliberate conventions:
;;
;; - A whitespace-only line counts as blank, matching `org-element'.  Rendering
;;   therefore emits a truly empty line where the source had spaces.  Trailing
;;   whitespace is explicitly out of scope for this feature.
;; - A file with mixed line endings parses to nil rather than being silently
;;   normalised.  Callers report it and skip the file.
