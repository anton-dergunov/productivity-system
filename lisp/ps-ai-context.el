;;; ps-ai-context.el --- Generate the AI assistant's context file -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; An AI assistant editing the user's Org files (see lisp/ps-claude.el and
;; samples/realistic/AGENTS.md) needs two kinds of facts that a human would
;; otherwise have to keep up to date by hand:
;;
;;   1. How tasks are represented -- TODO keywords, priorities, tags, DONE
;;      logging, journal layout, which directory feeds the agenda. config.org is
;;      the single source of truth for all of it.
;;   2. What each plan file is for -- taken from each file's `#+SUBTITLE:' line,
;;      so the assistant can route something without opening every file.
;;
;; Duplicating either into a hand-written AGENTS.md creates a second source that
;; silently drifts; re-deriving them every session wastes tokens. So Emacs
;; generates them into one file, `ps/ai-context-file' (by default
;; `.claude/generated-context.md' under `my-org-base-directory'), which AGENTS.md
;; simply points at. AGENTS.md itself stays entirely hand-written and is never
;; touched from here -- which also means the generated file can be gitignored.
;; See design/ai/agent-context.md for the fuller analysis.
;;
;; `ps/ai-context-sync' writes that file, but only when the rendered content has
;; actually changed, so a no-op run leaves the file's mtime untouched (this
;; matters for git/Obsidian-style file sync). `ps/ai-context--render-document'
;; and the renderers below it are pure functions of explicit values, kept
;; separate so they can be tested without any live Emacs/Org state.
;;
;; It is called from two places. Once at the very end of config.org, after every
;; value it reads has already been set earlier in the same load pass -- that
;; single call site covers both a fresh Emacs startup and `ps/reload-config'
;; (`C-c p R'), since the latter just re-runs config.org end to end. And, via
;; `ps/ai-context-setup-hooks', a debounced rescan after any scanned .org file is
;; saved, which is what keeps the file index current as subtitles are edited and
;; files are added. Saving config.org (`ps/tangle-config-on-save') deliberately
;; does *not* trigger a sync: it only re-tangles to config.el on disk without
;; re-executing the buffer, so the live values (e.g. `org-todo-keywords') haven't
;; actually changed yet -- syncing there would regenerate from stale state.
