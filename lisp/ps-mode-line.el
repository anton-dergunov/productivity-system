;;; ps-mode-line.el --- Planning-focused mode line -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; A compact, planning-oriented mode line.
;;
;; Plan files show:     <file> [· <tasks>] · <pct>% · <heading breadcrumb>
;; Agenda buffers show: <view title> [· <pct>%]
;; Everything else:     <~/abbreviated/path> [•] [· <pct>%]
;;
;; "Plan file" means one the agenda scans (`ps/org-files-in-scope-p'), not
;; merely one in Org mode: the capture queue and this repository's own docs are
;; Org too, and a heading path through a generated list is not something anyone
;; reads.  What those need naming is which file they are, which is why the third
;; shape shows a path where the first shows a short name.
;;
;; The filename drops its ".org" extension, and gains its folder as a prefix
;; ("Personal/Inbox") when two open files share a name; the position is a
;; percentage only (the line-number gutter already shows the line); the
;; breadcrumb is the ancestor + current heading TITLES (no TODO keyword,
;; priority, tags, or cookies).  When the line overflows, breadcrumb segments are
;; ellipsized individually, longest first, while the filename and position are
;; always preserved.
;;
;; Minor-mode lighters and the git-sync indicator are intentionally omitted
;; everywhere (git-sync lives in the file-tree mode line).  So is save state,
;; for a plan file -- those are saved for you -- but not for anything else: a
;; Markdown note nothing auto-saves gets a `•' until it is written.
