;;; screenshot.el --- Capture a PNG of the running frame -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Loaded by scripts/screenshot_theme.sh AFTER the normal config has finished
;; loading.  It builds a two-window layout (a chosen org file on top, the Super
;; Agenda below, split evenly), waits for a redisplay, then captures the
;; current graphical frame to the file named in the PS_SCREENSHOT_OUT env var
;; using the macOS `screencapture' tool against the frame's outer edges
;; (`frame-edges'), so the whole Emacs window including the title bar is saved.
;;
;; If PS_SCREENSHOT_FAKE_DATE is set (e.g. "2026-05-21 10:00"), Emacs/Org is
;; tricked into believing "now" is that time for this session, so the fixed
;; SCHEDULED/DEADLINE dates in samples/realistic/ show up as overdue/today/
;; upcoming as intended without editing the sample files.
;;
;; This is macOS-only and needs a graphical frame, so the launching script must
;; NOT use -nw.  The controlling terminal must have Screen Recording permission,
;; otherwise `screencapture' produces a blank/desktop-only image. It also needs
;; Accessibility/Automation permission (to control "System Events"), used here
;; to bring this Emacs window to the front before capturing.
;;
;; To manually inspect the layout for a given fake date without the 2-second
;; auto-capture-then-quit, set PS_SCREENSHOT_INTERACTIVE=1: Emacs builds the
;; same two-window layout and stays open for interactive use.
